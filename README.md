ðŸ”‘ API Used
We use ExchangeRate-API to fetch the latest exchange rates. You will need your own API key.
Replace the BASE_URL in app.js with your own key:
const BASE_URL = "https://v6.exchangerate-api.com/v6/YOUR-API-KEY/latest";

ðŸ§  How It Works
On page load, the default conversion is set (USD to NPR).

Users can enter an amount and select currencies from dropdowns.

The app fetches the latest exchange rates from the API.

It updates the conversion message with the final amount.

Flag images dynamically update based on currency selection.
